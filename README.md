Lab Task - Trading Agent for Smartphone Inventory
Management:
One has to develop a trading agent for Smartphone Inventory Management. There will be
two or more controllers (E.G. "Price Monitoring Controller", "Inventory Monitoring
Controller", "Ordering Controller" etc.).

Example: If the smartphone price drops to 500 BDT (from an average of 600 BDT) and there
are 20 units in stock, the agent might decide to order 15 more units.
• If the stock level is critical, (e.g., less than 10), the agent orders a minimum quantity
(e.g., 10 units).

• Otherwise, if neither condition is met, the agent does not place an order (i.e., tobuy
= 0).
Submission
• Submit the GitHub link of the code.
• The code should full fill all the conditions specified in Task 1 and generate a graph as
shown in example.
